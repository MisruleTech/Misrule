        <p>Site deployed, Sections added. DNS + Pages working.</p>
        <strong><h3>12/17/2025 Day 2</h3></strong> 
        <p>Created the page "Labs & Fieldwork" as well as the relevant sections.<br>
        Provided the page with the ability to be navigated to and from within pages, "Log" and "Home".<br> 
        I feel more confident about utilizing HTML and its basic syntax.<br>
        In order to further develop the web page I will be uploading work completed from TryHackMe and other
        commonly used platforms that provide free labs. </p>
